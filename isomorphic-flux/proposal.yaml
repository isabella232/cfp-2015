  Title: Isomorphic Flux
  Description: >
    Flux provides a good framework for building rich client applications, but
    did you know you can reuse the flux architecture for server rendering? In
    this talk, I'll walk you through an isomorphic Flux architecture to give
    you the holy grail of frontend development. With this architecture you'll be
    able to reuse all of your application code on the server and client without
    worrying about server-side concurrency issues that you may see with stock
    Flux.

    Once the concepts have been explained, I will introduce the open source
    libraries that we have open sourced and are powering many of Yahoo's
    high-traffic web applications.
