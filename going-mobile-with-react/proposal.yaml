Session:
  Title: Going Mobile with React
  Description: >
    React.js is changing the way developers think about mobile app development,
    especially with the recent announcement of React Native. However, in many
    ways hybrid (web + mobile) app development is here to stay for a large
    number of mobile apps.
    
    Everyone's heard "you can't build a native experience in a web view". We
    disagree. You just have to know the right tricks. And when you do, the web
    becomes an incredibly powerful platform for delivering amazing user
    experience using the technology you know.
    
    At Thinkmill in Sydney, over the course of developing several commercial
    apps, we've experienced the power of using ReactJS for mobile apps built on
    web technology, and developed a framework we call TouchstoneJS (which Tom
    Occhino called "the best looking and feeling implementation of this that
    I've seen" during the Q&A session at React Conf) to share this capability
    with developers around the world.
    
    In this talk I'll share what we've learned and how we've approached the
    unique challenges of mobile web apps - with tools that are useful to all
    developers building touch interfaces with React, as well as a walkthrough
    of our development process and framework.
    
    I'll also talk about what you can do with the web platform that you can't
    with native apps, and even React Native.
