  Title: Relay: An Application Framework For React
  Description: >
    Relay is a new framework from Facebook that enables declarative data
    fetching & updates for React applications. Relay components use GraphQL to
    specify their data requirements, and compose together to form truly modular
    applications. This talk will explore the problems Relay solves, its
    architecture and the query lifecycle, and how can you use Relay to build
    more scalable apps. Weâ€™ll also see examples of how Relay powers applications
    as complex as the Facebook News Feed.
