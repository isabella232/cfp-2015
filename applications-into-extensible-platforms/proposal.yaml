  Title: How React & Flux Turn Applications Into Extensible Platforms
  Description: >
    Chrome is great, but 3rd party extensions make it better. The iPhone
    is great, but apps make it better. You React-app may be great, but
    imagine if you could safely and robustly allow 3rd party extensions to
    enhance it.

    We'll talk about specific features of React & Flux, React CSS,
    programming design patterns, and custom libraries, which can turn a
    static application into a dynamic platform that an ecosystem of
    developers can build on top of.

    We've built a highly-extensible desktop email client with React & Flux
    on Atom Shell, and we'll also show concrete examples of where these
    tools enabled a 3rd party ecosystem of email plugins.

    Our goal is for you to take away how to use React to be more than just
    great application developers, but now great platform developers as
    well.
