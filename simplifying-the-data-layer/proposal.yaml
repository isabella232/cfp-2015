  Title: Simplifying the data layer
  Description: >
    At Twitter, teams have starting adopting React because it’s enabled
    UI engineers to forget about time when writing rendering code.
    And we've started exploring similar simplifications in the data
    layer, embracing the UI’s role as part of a distributed system.

    First, we'll share how user experience choices are a primary influence on
    how we design the data layer, especially for teams developing new products
    with full-stack capabilities.  Working with data from multiple backend
    services has powerful benefits, and shapes the problem space for
    UI engineering.

    Next, we'll look at how React and Flux approaches can help in our
    problem scenarios.  Yet even after the advances in React’s component model,
    the data layer is still an important source of complexity as an app grows
    and changes over time.

    Finally, we'll look at new approaches we’ve been exploring, and how designs
    like decoupling 'recording facts' from 'computing views of those facts'
    have influenced UI engineering.  These designs nudge teams towards
    simplicity when creating impactful user-facing improvements like
    real-time updates, optimistic commits, and graceful handling of
    network outages.

  bio: >
    Kevin's especially interested in exploratory data science and visualization,
    working to create user experiencers that directly help users do what they need
    to to, or understand what they need to know.  He loves connecting knowledge from
    different fields, and at the moment is particularly inspired by work from the
    React and ClojureScript communities.

    He currently works as an engineer at Twitter in Boston, as part of the Fabric team
    developing tools for mobile developers.  In a past career, he worked as a teacher
    and continues to volunteer working with high-school and undergraduate students
    teaching about engineering.
