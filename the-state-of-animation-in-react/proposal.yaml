  Title: The State of Animation in React
  Description: >
    A talk on the past, the present and the future of animation, and the place
    React can potentially take in this. I will be focusing on a few experiments
    on animation I've done, specifically: react-tween-state, react-state-stream
    and some unreleased transition-group related thoughts and work.
