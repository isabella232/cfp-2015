  Title: "Live React: Hot Reloading with Time Travel"
  Description: >
    React’s unique strength is bringing to JavaScript development some of the
    benefits previously exclusive to more radically functional languages such as
    Elm and ClojureScript, without forcing you to completely eschew local state
    or rewrite code with exclusively immutable data structures.

    In this talk, Dan will demonstrate how React can be used together with
    Webpack Hot Module Replacement to create a live editing environment with
    time travel that supercharges your debugging experience and transforms the
    way you work on real apps every day.
