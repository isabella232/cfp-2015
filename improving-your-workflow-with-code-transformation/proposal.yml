  Title: Improving Your Workflow With Code Transformation
  Description: >
    Most React developers already use a build pipeline to transform their JSX
    into vanilla JavaScript. This is usually under-utilised only doing basic
    transformations such as concatenation, minification and linting.

    In this talk, Sebastian will go over how this already existing infrastructure
    can be further utilised to perform even more significant code transformations
    such as transpilation, optimisation, profiling and more, reducing bugs,
    making your code faster and you as a developer more productive and happy.
