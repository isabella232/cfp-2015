  Title: A deep dive into GraphQL
  Description: >
    At React.js Conf last January, we introduced the idea of GraphQL: a data fetching language that allows clients to declaratively describe their data requirements. In this talk, we'll take a deeper dive into GraphQL. How can we build a GraphQL API to work with an existing REST API or data model? What are best practices in building out our GraphQL APIs, and how do they differ from traditional REST best practices? How does GraphQL handle writes and consistency after a write has occurred? Most importantly, what does a complete and coherent GraphQL API looks like, and how can we get started building one?
